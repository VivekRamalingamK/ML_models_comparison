This is a simple machine learning project which does comparison of Random Forest Classifier model and Logistic Regression model using the breast cancer
 dataset [1] from sklearn package.
 
 Aim:
 
 
1. Binary classification - to classify cancer or not using machine learning models - Logistic regression and Random Forest classifier
2. Compare the results of Logistic regression and Random Forest classifier

 
 Steps:
 
 1. Data Pre-processing: Test-train split and input data scaling using standard scaler.
 2. Model Training: Simple hand-tuning of hyper parameters. Parameters tuned - max_depth and n_estimators for Random Forest and C for Logistic Regression.
 3. Evaluation using different metrics: Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Confusion Matrix and ROC (AUC)
 4. Comparison of Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.
 
 Results:
 
 Logistic regression is slightly better than Random Forest Regresssion.
